<!-- Comments are not evaluated as code. Thus, they can be used to communicate to other devs reading your source, as well as rendering code segments inactive without deleting them. For example: this comment! Each language has its own comment conventions, and HTML's are these dashes with greater/less than signs that you see. The bang is what differentiates the opening from the closing brace. -->
