<!-- 
    Radio buttons are another input type, and allow the user to select one of multiple options in the same group. They have a lot of moving parts that have to be kept track of. To make a functioning and best-practice-following group of radio inputs...

    1. Create a label for each input
    2. Create inputs and nest each one under a label
    3. Set the name attribute on every input that you want to be part of the 
       group to something descriptive of said group
    4. Set the inputs' type attribute to radio
    5. Set the inputs' id attribute to something descriptive of that option
    6. Set the for attribute of its label so that it matches the id

    Failure to follow this set of rules will result in mucho sadness
