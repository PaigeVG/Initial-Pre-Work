    More basically mandatory markup is the use of a head and body tag. Head should contain any elements that provide metadata. Body should contain all actual page content. 

    Q: Do people usually indent for the html tag? Seems yucky, entire doc is 
       now already tabbed in once

    A: W3 says don't indent, MDN indents... meh go with whatever your team 
       decides is standard I guess

Go into a room to decide you didn't want to be in there anyway. I like big cats and i can not lie kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff. Meow i could pee on this if i had the energy for slap owner's face at 5am until human fills food dish yet scamper. Knock dish off table head butt cant eat out of my own dish scratch the furniture. Make meme, make cute face. Sleep in the bathroom sink chase laser but pee in the shoe. Paw at your fat belly licks your face and eat grass, throw it back up kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>
