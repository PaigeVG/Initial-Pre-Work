<!-- 
A flex container has a main axis and a cross axis defined by flex-direction, where the main axis is the direction along which the flex items are arranged. 

The property justify-content allows you to control how any space between flex items on the main axis is divied up. There are lots of choices for the value of this property.

center        pushes items towards container center

flex-start    pushes items towards main start

flex-end      pushes items towards main end

space-between pushes first item to main start and last   
              item to main end, with other elements evenly spaced between them.

space-around  is the same as -between except that first    
              and last are simply spaced like the other items.
