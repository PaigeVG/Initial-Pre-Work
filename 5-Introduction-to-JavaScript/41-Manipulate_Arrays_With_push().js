// Once you access an array element with bracket notation, you have that element in hand as a value. So, if that value is another array that you want to access, you just pop another set of brackets on.

// Setup
var myArray = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [[10,11,12], 13, 14]];

// Only change code below this line.
var myData = myArray[2][1];
