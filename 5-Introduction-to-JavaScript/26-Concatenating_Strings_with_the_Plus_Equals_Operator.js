// += for strings is analagous to += for numbers. It takes the existing value of a string variable and concats whatever is to the right. 

// Example
var ourStr = "I come first. ";
ourStr += "I come second.";

// Only change code below this line
var myStr = "This is the first sentence. "
myStr += "This is the second sentence.";
