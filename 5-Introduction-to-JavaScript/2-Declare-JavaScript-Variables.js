/*
Javascript has several different data types. Different kinds of operations are applicable to each. 

Variables act as a label for data, and allow for dynamic data storage and manipulation.

Variables are declared with the var keyword, and can contain any alphanumeric character as well as underscores and dollar signs. They may not start with a number.

Statements are ended with semicolons.
