// Objects are a type of collection that stores structured data in properties, which are strings (or numbers, which are typecast as strings in the end).

// Example
var ourDog = {
  "name": "Camper",
  "legs": 4,
  "tails": 1,
  "friends": ["everything!"]
};

// Only change code below this line.

var myDog = {
  "name": "Galvantula",
  "legs": 8,
  "tails": 0,
  "friends": ["me", "you", "pikachu"]
};
