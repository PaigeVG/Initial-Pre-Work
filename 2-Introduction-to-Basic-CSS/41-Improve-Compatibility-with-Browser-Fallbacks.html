Set fallbacks for browser compatibility purposes by setting a redundant declaration higher than your "real" one. New browser will read both and use the lower, "real" value, old browser will ignore the "real" and stick with the higher definition.

Q: Doesn't this kind of defeat the purpose of variables? Now I have to maintain a series of ad-hoc backup declarations anyway. :(
